#ðŸ‘½ CStealer ðŸ‘½

âœ¨ CStealer is a new tool made by Mark Security and inspired by @opps3c's Pythonic tool.
CStealer aims to create a file called <b>main.c</b> so that C beginners can learn more easily
the C language and what each command represents.

ðŸ˜¼ Tool This was written in C itself so if you want to make changes to the tool or add new values, you are allowed! This entire repository 
was inspired by @opps3c's Pythonic tool, so if you're interested, go to the Github from @opps3c.
